The simpleapp application in the myapp project is a web app that lets users see ratings and description of various movies.
The api application creates api of the simpleapp models.

For the Movie model in simpleapp, we have created a corresponding Serializer in api app. It lists out the fields that need to 
be serialized.

The superuser to access the admin functions is
username - ekwinder
password - 123

other created users -
username - user1
password -123

The API can only be accessed by user authentication. 
Add, Edit and Delete functions can only be accessed by Admin.
Search function can be accessed by all authenticated users.
